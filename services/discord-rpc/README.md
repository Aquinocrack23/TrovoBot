# Discord RPC Service

## Created by: Bioblaze Payne

### What this is.

This was created to allow you to display what you are streaming on trovo, from trovobot. Onto your Discord Activity. It works based off your "OBS" or "Streamlabs OBS" stream being activated. As long as the the services for interfacing with either of the two are activated.

Language Translations and Lines can be found under `services`.`discordrpc` in the en.json file. Or your selected language that is within the system.


### Settings

You can change the title of your Stream within the `discord-rpc.json` file in the `title` field.
You can also put the name of your character/account in the `player` field.

If you would like to create your own activity for discord so you can add your own artwork and such, please change the `clientID` too one that is found on the developers portal for discord.

If you do not wish todo that, please do not change the `clientID` as it will not work at all for you without it.
